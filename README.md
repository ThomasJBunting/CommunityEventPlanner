# Project Overview:
- Allocated two hours for the project.
- Creation of api project, blazer project, unit test, and integration test, projects inside the solution 

#Requirements 
- Docker Desktop
- Microsoft SQL database

# Technical Details:
- Focused on creating the community events API after setting up database relationships in EF Core.
- Index ensures users can only book an event once (both in database and API).
- Dependency injection added with services 
- Identity added but not incorporated 
- Established unit testing and integrated testing projects (no content added yet).

# Plan Not completed:
- API security: JWT tokens via Microsoft Identity with SQL database.
- use Dockerized Microsoft SQL database for integrated testing.
- Blazor front end: Syncfusion / Quick Grids to display upcoming events.

# Reflection:
- Possibility of using an MVC templated web project scaled back as an API may have been faster as identities are already added 
- Could possibly do with checking the store to see if there are templates available to increase development speed.
