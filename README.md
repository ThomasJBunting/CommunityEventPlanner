# Project Overview:
- Allocated two hours for the project.
- Requirements: Docker Desktop, locally installed Microsoft SQL database.
- Focused on creating the community events API after setting up database relationships in EF Core.
- Index ensures users can only book an event once (both in database and API).

# Technical Details:
- Created event controller and set up dependency injection.
- Established unit testing and integrated testing projects (no content added yet).
- Plan to use Dockerized Microsoft SQL database for integrated testing.
- Blazor front end: Bootstrap mixed with Syncfusion or Quick Grids to display upcoming events.
- API security: JWT tokens via Microsoft Identity with SQL database.

# Reflection:
- Consider using templates or finding one with Microsoft Identities and Entity Framework Core for quicker development.
- Alternatively, share a custom API on Git as a reference.
